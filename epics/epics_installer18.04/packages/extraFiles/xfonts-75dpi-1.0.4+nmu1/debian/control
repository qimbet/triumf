Suggests: xfs | xserver
Description: 75 dpi fonts for X 
 xfonts-75dpi provides a set of bitmapped fonts at 75 dots per inch.  In
 most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server
 installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package contains only fonts in the ISO 10646-1 and ISO 8859-1
 encodings, to conserve disk space.  For other encodings, see the
 xfonts-75dpi-transcoded package.
 .
 This package and xfonts-100dpi provide the same set of fonts, rendered at
 different resolutions; only one or the other is necessary, but both may be
 installed.  xfonts-75dpi may be more suitable for small monitors and/or
 small screen resolutions (under 1024x768).
 .
 This package requires the xfonts-utils package to prepare the font 
 directories for use by an X server or X font server.
