When pushing to github, sub-repositories are not uploaded. 
Fair enough; why host the same thing twice

For reference, the gitRepos directory contains clones of the two repositories. 
Clone commands are listed:

sudo git clone --branch 3.15 https://github.com/epics-base/epics-base.git
sudo git clone https://github.com/epicsdeb/edm.git
